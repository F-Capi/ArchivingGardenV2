                sources are altered or removed. This transparency allows citizens to verify facts, trace the
                evolution of public statements, and hold institutions and leaders accountable for their actions.
                Furthermore, Internet archives support the free flow of information, enabling a diverse range of
                voices and perspectives to be preserved and accessed. This openness fosters an informed electorate,
                encourages public discourse, and upholds the democratic principles of transparency, accountability,
                and participation.</p> <img id="info-6" class="movable-element" src="/images/info2.png" alt="">
