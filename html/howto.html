        <p class="document-text" id="par1">When it comes to archiving your creative work, there are both obvious and
            less obvious reasons to stay on top of it. Everyone will have different objectives (and levels of urgency)
            for archiving their work, as well as variations in how they approach the process.</p>
        <div class="document-tag" id="tag1">Set goals for what you want to achieve</div>
        <p id="box1">It’s extremely valuable to define your goals for archiving at the very beginning, so that you have
            an easier time staying on track (and also staying motivated).
            One of the possible benefits of archiving includes making it easier to update your portfolio. Additionally,
            getting into the habit of archiving your work as you make it will enable you to find past press clips and
            documentation from older projects if you find they become relevant for a new opportunity.
            Additionally, keeping an up-to-date public portfolio of your work online is a key way to communicate your
            skills and be discovered (for more on this, read How to make a website for your creative work). Furthermore,
            keeping clips (screenshots and/or PDFs) of online publications that include your work can help to validate
            public profiles like your Wikipedia page or LinkedIn.
        </p>

        <div id="box2">
            <p>The process of archiving your work can also provide productive hindsight, and even help you break out of
                a creative rut. Re-familiarizing yourself with your past work—some of which you may have forgotten
                about—can be a powerful process. Taking a moment to review and collect what you’ve done in the past can
                remind you of your creative and professional evolution, and can even give you clues for what kinds of
                work to pursue next. Plus, if you’re looking for new ways to communicate the value of your work, or if
                you’re thinking about writing a new artist statement, the archiving process will be an immensely helpful
                way to take stock of your accomplishments.</p>
            <p>Lastly, archiving ensures that you don’t lose access to work. Practically speaking, websites, social
                media platforms, and media outlets tend to evolve, change hands, or even shut down. And, if you’re
                making physical work or publishing articles in print, it can be just as easy to lose access to (or more
                likely, lose track of) this kind of work. By taking the time to have all of your work and press clips
                safely documented and at your disposal, you can be your own best advocate in the long run.</p>

        <div class="document-subtitle" id="title2">[02] Make a list of all the work you want to archive</div>
        <div class="document-text" id="par2">The first step in archiving your work will be to create a “master”
            spreadsheet, or use a productivity tracker (like Slack or Notion), to start a list of all the work you’d
            like to archive.
            Start by noting the following for each work, which can be translated to spreadsheet columns:</div>
        <div id="box4">
            <ul>
                <li>The name of the work (or a reference name for it)</li>
                <li>The approximate date it was created or published/released</li>
                <li>The client, outlet, gallery, or similar partner</li>
                <li>A URL (N/A for physical work)</li>
                <li>Whether archiving the work will require physical and/or digital documentation</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <span id="tag2">You may also want to note:</span>
        <div id="box5">
            <ul>
                <li>The project that the work was a part of</li>
                <li>The medium or type of work</li>
                <li>Any other miscellaneous or obscure details, including the existence of process materials or notable
                    press</li>

            </ul>
        </div>
        <p class="document-text" id="par3">This will help you define the scope of your archiving project, and will help
            you break the work
            down into manageable chunks. If you have work that you want or need to showcase more immediately, put it
            towards the top of your list. If you want to start at the beginning and go chronologically, do that.</p>
        <div class="document-tag" id="tag3">Use the list of work to get a sense of how you’ll want to organize your
            archive</div>
        <p class="document-text" id="par4">Create organizational folders that make it easier to retrieve files in the
            future. Here are some organizational structures that could help you break up your work into folders,
            depending on your preference/way of working:</p>
        <div id="box6">
            <ul>
                <li>Year</li>
                <li>Client</li>
                <li>Project</li>
                <li>Genre/type of work</li>

            </ul>
        </div>
        <p class="document-text" id="par5">Decide on a file-naming structure—ideally one that’s easily searchable and
            understandable to you. An example might be: <a href="#">PROJECT NAME_CLIENT_YEAR.pdf.</a></p>
        <div class="document-tag" id="tag4">
            Get all the tools you’ll need in place
        </div>
        <p class="document-text" id="par6">In addition to your master spreadsheet and/or productivity tracker, get the
            tools below ready for the archiving process:</p>

        <div id="box7">
            <h3>A fail-proof file-storage system:</h3>
            <p>Consider choosing a cloud-based storage solution, like Dropbox or Google Drive, so that none of your work
                gets potentially lost to a computer or hard drive malfunction. <a

                    up
                    your files, see this article.</a></p>
            <h3>A tool to screen-capture your digital work:</h3>
            <p>Tools like <a
                    href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/gofullpage-full-page-scre/fdpohaocaechififmbbbbbknoalclacl?hl=en">Google
                    Chrome’s Full Page Screen Capture</a> plugin, FastStone Capture, SnagIt, or
                Nimbus
                Screenshot will be key for capturing PNG and/or PDF files of your online work.</p>


        </div>
        <div class="document-subtitle" id="title3">[03] Archive The Digital Work</div>
        <p class="document-text" id="par7">Start with the first item in your master spreadsheet. Using your chosen
            screen-capture or screen-recording tool, go to the URL you want to “capture.” Download both the PDF and PNG
            files (if your tool has the option to save both), rename them based on your chosen file naming scheme, and
            place the files into their correct folders. This is also the time to capture positive press about the work
            you’re archiving, process documentation, or anything else worth saving. If helpful, you can create a folder
            within the work’s main folder labeled “Press,” “Process documentation,” etc.</p>
        <div id="title4">Begin The Capturing And Filing Process</div>
        <p class="document-text" id="par8">If your files already exist in digital form, such as digital photography,
            animations, or video, you’ll be able to go straight to gathering your files and renaming them for their
            various folders, as long as they are already uploaded to your computer. However, if these assets live on
            websites or have been sourced and embedded in ways that you’d like to document, consider screen-capturing
            them.
            Once you get your system in place, you will get into the flow. Keep moving through your master spreadsheet,
            leaving notes if there is a physical element of any work that needs to be documented.</p>
        <div class="document-subtitle" id="tag5">[04] Archive The Physical Work </div>
        <div id="box8">
            <h3>Gather Everything First</h3>
            <p>After completing the archiving process for your digital work, you should have a clear list of any
                physical work that needs to be documented. Start this process by gathering all of your physical
                artworks, press clips, printed publications, etc. in one place. This helps you then divide what you need
                to photograph or scan.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="box9">
            <h3>Determine The Presentation Style</h3>
            <p>Come up with your preferred direction for how you want the physical work to be presented digitally. Will
                iPhone photos suffice, or do you need professional images? Do you want individual pieces to look
                uniform, whether they be book covers or pieces of art or furniture? Will you use a white backdrop each
                time, will you simply use natural light, and/or will you need to do any image editing? It can be helpful
                to gather reference images in order to help you determine how you’d like your final files to appear.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="box10">
            <h3>Receive And Organize Files</h3>
            <p>Once physical work has been captured, rename the files using your chosen file-naming scheme and sort them
                into the folders you’ve made.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="box11">
            <h3>Make Archiving Part Of Your Creation Process</h3>
            <p>If the last step of your typical working process is hitting “send” on an email, filing an invoice, or
                sharing work on social media, consider making the archiving process your true last step. If this seems
                impossible, then at minimum, write down your archiving process somewhere, so that if you neglect to
                archive for a long time, it will be easier for you to pick up where you left off.</p>
